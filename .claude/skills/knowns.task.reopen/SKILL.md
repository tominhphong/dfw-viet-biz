# Reopening Tasks

Reopen completed tasks properly with time tracking and requirement documentation.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the knowns.task.reopen skill to reopen task [ID]."

**Core principle:** DOCUMENT WHY THE TASK IS REOPENED.

## The Process

### Step 1: View Current Task State

```json
mcp__knowns__get_task({ "taskId": "$ARGUMENTS" })
```

Verify:
- Task is currently `done`
- Understand what was implemented
- Review implementation notes

### Step 2: Reopen and Start Timer

```json
// Set back to in-progress
mcp__knowns__update_task({
  "taskId": "$ARGUMENTS",
  "status": "in-progress"
})

// Start timer (REQUIRED)
mcp__knowns__start_time({ "taskId": "$ARGUMENTS" })
```

### Step 3: Document Reopen Reason

```json
mcp__knowns__update_task({
  "taskId": "$ARGUMENTS",
  "appendNotes": "🔄 Reopened: <reason>"
})
```

**Common reasons:**
- User requested changes
- Bug found in implementation
- New requirements added
- Missed acceptance criteria

### Step 4: Add New Requirements

```json
mcp__knowns__update_task({
  "taskId": "$ARGUMENTS",
  "addAc": ["New requirement 1", "Fix: issue description"]
})
```

### Step 5: Update Plan (if needed)

```json
mcp__knowns__update_task({
  "taskId": "$ARGUMENTS",
  "plan": "Previous plan + new steps:\n1. Original step (done)\n2. Original step (done)\n3. NEW: Address new requirement\n4. NEW: Fix reported issue"
})
```

**Present updated plan and WAIT for approval.**

### Step 6: Implement and Complete

Follow normal task completion flow:

```json
// Check new ACs as completed
mcp__knowns__update_task({
  "taskId": "$ARGUMENTS",
  "checkAc": [<new-index>],
  "appendNotes": "✓ Done: new requirement"
})

// Stop timer
mcp__knowns__stop_time({ "taskId": "$ARGUMENTS" })

// Mark done again
mcp__knowns__update_task({
  "taskId": "$ARGUMENTS",
  "status": "done"
})
```

## When to Reopen vs Create New Task

| Reopen Existing | Create New Task |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Small fix/change | Major new feature |
| Related to original work | Unrelated work |
| Same context needed | Different context |
| Quick addition | Significant scope |

**Rule of thumb:** If it takes < 30 mins and relates to original task, reopen. Otherwise, create new task with reference.

## Creating Follow-up Task Instead

```json
mcp__knowns__create_task({
  "title": "Follow-up: <description>",
  "description": "Related to @task-$ARGUMENTS"
})
```

## Remember

- Always document reopen reason
- Start timer when reopening
- Add new AC for traceability
- Stop timer when done
- Consider if new task is more appropriate
